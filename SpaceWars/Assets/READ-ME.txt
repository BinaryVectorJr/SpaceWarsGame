////////////////////////// IMPORTANT INFO //////////////////////////


Unity has deprecated its Networking tools for 2020 and above versions, hence I am using a user created and maintained asset called Mirror.
Link (https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror)

So far, I have not encountered any problems implementing the basic features needed to accomplish basic networking (apart from a few changes in the scripts here and there).
Most of the references I have kept it direct rather than include the Mirror library directly (why? IDK, thought it would be easier for others to understand it later)

But yeah, as of 21st July 2021 - I am able to spawn a host player and a client player, and movements can be done on both ends (since each player has Local Authority)
and the positions and rotations update in both sides (screens?).
